Machine Learning is a natural choice in the Logistics domain for various problems like predicting the mode of movements of goods i.e. rail vs. road, predicting trailer types, etc. StARLinG Lab along with [Turvo](http://www.turvo.com) is looking to create an automated statistician which will embed the relations in a knowledge graph from shipments. We are also building a regressor model which would provide an approximate cost of the shipments and hence aid brokers to bargain a fair price.
