## Quick Overview

**Accepted** at the 11th International Conference on Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM) 
([PGM 2022](https://www2.ual.es/pgm2022/)).

In this work: 
(**1**) We developed CSI-Trees, a tree structured representation for context-specific independence relations, 
(**2**) we developed an algorithm, $\mathcal{EXSPN}$, to explain sum-product networks in terms of the context-specific independences encoded in them,
(**3**) we adapted our algorithm to a data set for predicting gestational diabetes from clinical observations

## Sum-Product Networks

Sum-Product Networks (SPN) are a class of deep probabilistic models. Their structure is represented by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The DAG consists of Sum ($+$) and Product ($\times$) nodes as internal nodes, and univariate distributions at the leaf nodes. Sum nodes represent a mixture of distributions and Product nodes represent a factorized distribution. While SPNs guarantee tractable inference, the presence of latent variables due to the Sum nodes makes them hard to explain to domain experts.

</div>
<br>  

For example, the SPN shown in the figure above represents the joint distribution $P(Write, Study, Pass)$ over three variables $Write$ ($W$), $Study$ ($S$) and $Pass$ ($P$).

>
$ P(W, S, P) = 0.49 P_1(W)P_2(S)P_3(P) + 0.51 P_4(W) (0.5 P_5(S)P_6(P)+ 0.5 P_7(S)P_8(P)) $

Where $P_1, \dots, P_8$ are the univariate probability distributions at the leaf nodes, from left to right.

## Context-specific Independence
Context-Specific Independence (CSI) is a generalization of the notion of Conditional Independence. For example, consider the following statement
>
Passing the exam is independent of Studying if I don't write my answers.

Here, the independence relation holds only in a particular region of the sample space where $Write$ is False. Formally,
$Pass \perp\kern-5pt\perp Study \mid (\neg Write)$


## ExSPN: Explaining Sum-Product Networks
In this work, we propose the $\mathcal{EXSPN}$ algorithm to explain SPNs using the Context-Specific Independences encoded in them.
We use the notion of a CSI to define a CSI-tree that represents a hierarchy of contexts. In a CSI-Tree, the edge labels contain conditions that define the context and the partitions in each node represent groups of independent variables.
As shown in the figure below, $\mathcal{EXSPN}$ converts a given SPN to a CSI-tree by empirically approximating the context defined by each Sum node, and reading off the independences at each Product node.

## Application to Gestational Diabetes

We applied this to a domain where the goal was to predict gestational
diabetes from clinical observations. The figure belows shows the first two levels of the CSI-tree extracted from 
an SPN fit on the data. 


<div align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/project/exspn/numom2b_csi.png" width="600" />
</div>
<br>  


Here, $oDM$ is a boolean variable that represents whether or not the person has Gestational Diabetes. $Race$ is a categorical
variable having 8 categories namely, Non-Hispanic White (1), Non-Hispanic Black (2), Hispanic (3),
American Indian (4), Asian (5), Native Hawaiian (6), Other (7), and Multiracial (8). $Smoked3Months$
and $SmokedEver$ are boolean variables representing tobacco consumption. 

While the $BMI$ variable is independent of other variables when $oDM \neq 1$, it is dependent on $Age, Race, Education$ for the case when $oDM = 1$.
