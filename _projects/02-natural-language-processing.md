Natural language processing is a hard task for traditional machine learning models, since they tend to ignore the relationships between the sentences, words, and text in documents. Because of this, they require careful feature construction and often make assumptions about conditional independences between all of the elements.

Even then, typically these features do not scale with large amounts of natural language data. Therefore, methods which can extract relations from text and exploit these relations during learning and inference will reduce the need for careful feature construction, and also scale better into larger data sets.

Models learned using relational machine learning methods can be used to create robust and interpretable predictions. In these projects, BoostSRL has been applied to extracting relations from clinical data, adverse drug event relations, and financial documents.
