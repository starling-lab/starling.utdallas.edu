Our paper titled "Exploiting Domain Knowledge as Causal Independencies in Modeling Gestational Diabetes" has been accepted to the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB) 2023! We leverage expert domain knowledge provided in the form of qualitative influences and causal independencies to learn an explainable and interpretable model for predicting gestational diabetes.
