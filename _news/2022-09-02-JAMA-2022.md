Our paper on "Association of Genetic Predisposition and Physical Activity With Risk of Gestational Diabetes in Nulliparous Women" has been accepted at JAMA Network Open 2022. This paper attempts to answer the question "Are genetic predisposition to diabetes and physical activity in early pregnancy cooperatively associated with risk of gestational diabetes (GD) among nulliparous women?" and finds that physical activity in early pregnancy is associated with reduced risk of GD and reversal of excess risk in genetically predisposed individuals, and PRS may have utility in identifying women for targeted interventions.
