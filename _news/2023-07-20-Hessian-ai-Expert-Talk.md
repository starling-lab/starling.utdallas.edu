On Thursday, July 20th (8AM CST), Dr. Natarajan visits TU Darmstadt to give a talk on Neurosymbolic Learning via the integration of (Relational) Planning and (Deep) RL. Discover the challenges of constructing a two-level system and the importance of the interface between different components. Join us to learn about the RePReL system that constructs abstractions automatically using a dynamic Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) language.
