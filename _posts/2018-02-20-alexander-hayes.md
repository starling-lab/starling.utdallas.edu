My work is mostly centered on relational approaches to natural language processing. Approaches such as word2vec have increased interest in the context that words appear in beyond the bag-of-words model. The approach we focus on models the relations between words, document structure, and word attributes like part-of-speech; which can provide powerful insights for classification tasks.

This work has been applied to SEC Form S-1 Documents and known drug side effect information from the openFDA database. Work for the latter can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/batflyer/DrugInteractionDiscovery).

I am involved in the [Natural Language Processing](/projects/natural-language-processing/) project.
